# Spotify Clone (Basic)

This project is a basic visual clone of the Spotify web player interface, created using HTML and CSS.

## Features

*   **Sidebar:** Navigation links (Home, Search), Your Library section with placeholders for playlists and podcasts.
*   **Main Content Area:** Displays sections like "Recently Played", "Trending now near you", and "Featured Charts" using card layouts. Includes a sticky top bar with navigation controls and user options.
*   **Music Player Bar:** Fixed at the bottom, showing album art, song info, player controls (play, pause, next, previous), playback progress bar, and volume/other controls.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3

## File Structure

*   `Spotify.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
*   `Spotify.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the web page.
*   `assets/`: Folder containing all the images and icons used in the project.
*   `position.css`: An auxiliary CSS file, likely used for experimenting with CSS positioning concepts (may not be directly used by `Spotify.html`).
